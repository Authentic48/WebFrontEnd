# Lesson 2

## Objectives
1. Learn basic principles of web page development.
2. Learn how to build simple web page layouts.

## Result
* Complete tasks 3-16 from [http://learnlayout.com/](http://learnlayout.com/). To complete the task you will need to utilize the method described in the exercise.
* The main page (/index.html) should contain the list of links to pages with completed tasks.
* One page can contain more than one task, but the page itself should not be the only page on the whole website.
* Code layouts #2.1 and #3.2 from [http://www.dynamicdrive.com/style/layouts/category/C13/](http://www.dynamicdrive.com/style/layouts/category/C13/) should be done on individual pages. If you want, code the rest of the layouts (after completing the task, you can use any of them).
