# Practice 6
## Objective
1. Learn the syntax of the JavaScript language.
2. Learn the basics of JavaScript programming (how to work with data types, objects, functions).
3. Write an algorithm using the JavaScript language.

## Result
1. Implement binary search algorithm (ejudge task 125).
2. Implement merge sort algorithm (ejudge task 136).
3. Input and output operations should be processed with console.
4. The interface can be implemented in OOP style (if you figure it out yourself), or you can just use global functions.

You can solve any other task of your choice, the main point is not implementing a certain algorithm, but learning the syntax of the JavaScript language. The suggested tasks assuredly covers all the possibilities of the language you might need, so if you're going to pick up another task, watch carefully if you haven't missed anything.
